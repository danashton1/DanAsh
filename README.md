My Repository for demonstrating Hue lights memory game project.

Welcome to the repository for the development of this game. This game is designed to allow the user to enter the colour sequence they think they saw the hue lights make, the game then determines whether the user is correct or not and progressivly makes the game more challenging until the user runs out of lives.

I have created the pages and linked them together so i can navigate between them.
I have added some bootstrap code to creat the nav bar and some flashing spinners that represent the lights although i am undecided on whether or not ill keep the spinners as I may find a better wat to represent the lights.
