My Repository for demonstrating Hue lights memory game project.

Welcome to the repository for the development of Memory tester. This game is designed to allow the user to enter the colour sequence they think they saw the hue lights in SMB 109 lab make, the game then determines whether the user is correct or not and progressivly makes the game more challenging by increasing the length of the sequence until the user runs out of lives.

I have created the pages and linked them together so i can navigate between them using a fixed navagation bar at the topof the page.
I have added some bootstrap code so I can use the CSS to for things like my navigation bar and paragraphs. I have added some flashing spinners that represent the lights although I am undecided on whether or not i'll keep the spinners as I may find a better alternative to represent the lights.
